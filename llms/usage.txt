Chatgpt:This error message indicates that there are two \documentclass commands in your LaTeX document (paper.tex). This typically occurs when there is more than one document class defined in your Quarto file (paper.qmd), or when the document class is defined elsewhere in your project.

To resolve this issue, please check your paper.qmd file and ensure that there is only one \documentclass definition. Remove any duplicate or unnecessary document class definitions. Additionally, review your project to ensure that the document class is not defined in multiple places.

You can also refer to the paper.log file for more detailed information about the error, which may help you locate and fix the problem more effectively.
